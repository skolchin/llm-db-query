  title: Titanic Passenger Survival Dataset
  origin: Kaggle / Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University
  description: |
      A famous dataset based on the 1912 RMS Titanic disaster. It contains 
      demographic and travel details for passengers, specifically used to 
      determine which factors (like age, gender, or class) led to survival.
  usage:
    primary_purposes:
      - Introduction to [Binary Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) in machine learning.
      - Teaching Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization.
      - Practicing feature engineering and handling missing values (e.g., Age/Cabin).
    common_tasks:
      - Predicting survival (Survived: 0 or 1) using passenger attributes.
      - Analyzing the "women and children first" protocol via data.
      - Investigating socio-economic correlations between ticket class and survival.
